# Crystal Gem Collector
A basic click-game based off of Cartoon Network's show "Steven Universe". Each character from the program represents a hidden
number that will accumulate into the user's current score. If these randomized numbers fit into the target score, the user wins that round. Once they win a certain amount of wins, they can "unlock" a new character. 
## In development:
- There will be a sign-up for users. This way, their account can record their score so that they can compare it to other users
for competition.
- Additionally, a chat room will be created so that users can interact during or after the game.
