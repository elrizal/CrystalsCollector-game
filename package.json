  "description": "A basic click-game based off of Cartoon Network's show \"Steven Universe\". Each character from the program represents a hidden number that will accumulate into the user's current score. If these randomized numbers fit into the target score, the user wins that round. Once they win a certain amount of wins, they can \"unlock\" a new character.  ## In development: - There will be a sign-up for users. This way, their account can record their score so that they can compare it to other users for competition. - Additionally, a chat room will be created so that users can interact during or after the game.",
